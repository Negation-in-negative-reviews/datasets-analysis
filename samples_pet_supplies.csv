"I was recommended to use this for my cats. Two of my cats love it and the oldest one doesn't like any brush. I did really get it for the oldest one. This brush is cut down the middle. It conforms itself to the cats body. If I'm going over a leg and one side is bigger the sides will separate so that I'm not brushing them too hard. This gets a ton of hair off of my longer haired cat which helps with hair balls for all three of them. It's kind of hard to get the hair out of the bristles. That's my only complaint. But, when I think about it all brushes are like that. I have tossed all of my other brushes and use this exclusively.",5,0.45454545454545453

"My family consists of Me, my husband and our three cats, Bella, Cupcake and Ribbon. Cupcake is a cat with manners and a sense of dignity. She even waits in line to eat and poops with one paw daintily held in the air, something I liken to holding your pinky up when sipping tea. (We are weird, I know.) SHE is the one who has decreed what litter we use, what food we serve and the how she takes her water. (I bought a fountain for Bella and Ribbon, but she refuses to drink out of anything by a clean stainless steel bowl filled with stagnant water.) Well, I am just as picky as Cupcake (which is why I love her.) I REALLY didn't want to keep using gravel litter, I was raised using the cheapest litter available, which sucks. A lot. Then when I moved out I switched to scoop-able litter, which is better but still pretty much the same. The worst is having the hard-to-sweep-up litter all over the floor which gets stuck to your feet and gets into the carpet and grout. UH! I couldn't use a top loading box because cupcake won't do her business in confined spaces, so hoods are out of the question. I couldn't get eco-friendly corn litter because Cupcake doesn't like the smell and refuses to use it and opts to do her business NEXT to the litter box. I couldn't get the expensive self flushing litter box because I live in an apartment, and I don't want to bother figuring out how to plug it into the sewage system, if I can at all. I couldn't toilet train my cats, because, although I got Ribbon and Bella to participate and could have completely taught them how to do their business in the toilet, CUPCAKE suddenly decided she felt indignant trying to learn the toilet and stopped. No matter how hard I tried to SLOWLY retrain her, she just stopped. SO! After all I've been through, this worked for everyone. The Tidy Cat Breeze: I am SOOOOO happy I don't have to scoop sloppy cat piss piles any more! All you do is take a couple of Grocery Bags, double bag it, toss the pee pad out! ONCE A WEEK! AWESOME! (I go straight to the dumpster, not the garbage in the apartment.) We scoop the litter pellets a couple times a day. My cats poo doesn't stink to much, but I have a Litter Genie where all that poo goes and it's out of sight out of mind. I do a complete switch once a month, where I throw away the pad and the pellets, break the system down, soak it in hot water and an enzyme cleaner. Snap it all together, put in a pad and more pellets, BACK IN BUSINESS! It's so easy and clean! It's seriously the next best thing to straight up toilet training and self flushing, and Cupcake uses it! YAY! I love this thing so much! As for any pellets kicked out of the box, sometimes I pick them up and toss them back into the box, sometimes I sweep them up, but nothing is ever stuck in the grout or left behind to step on! Health Concerns: My cats have NOT suffered any health issues from this box. Cupcake and Ribbon did have Tapeworm (which is my worst nightmare come to life, I hate parasitic worms. Or all worms. Or any slimy invertebrates. But mostly parasitic slimy invertebrates.) What I was told would clean the box is soaking it in vinegar, and of course changing their flee medication to something that actually works... and also getting an exterminator to the apartment to finish off any remaining flees. If your cat is practicing Geophagy (eating minerals, such as litter) TAKE THEM TO THE VET! They are most likely ill in some way. Either their diet isn't nutritious enough. (Not enough meat, which it should ALWAYS be mostly or completely meat based, cats aren't rabbits, they're little meat eaters. Deal.) OR they could be suffering from a serious illness such as cancer, diabetes or kidney disease. It is not healthy for your cat to be ingesting its own litter ever, although the litter isn't toxic, it's not supposed to be food and your cat knows it. It is a sign of a potentially serious problem, or it could be a reasonably easy problem to fix, once you figure it out. I got Ribbon and Bella a water fountain because running water helps stimulate most cats to drink more water more often. It can help cut down on health problems in the future, and promote good kidney health to stay hydrated. Making sure your cats are hydrated and feeding them a nutrient rich diet is an important part of potty health. If your cats poo isn't a good consistency you can try feeding your cat canned mashed pumpkin straight from the grocery store. It will give them added fiber and they will consider it a treat. Cupcake, the Queen, loves it, and it did help with her bowel movements when she was having trouble. You could also try switching them to a better cat food, dry or wet. If your cat isn't having bowel movements that agree with this litter box, make sure they are completely healthy, because it's designed for healthy bowel movements.",30,0.5084745762711864
"I was looking for a litter scoop with smaller holes so I could clean out the very small pieces that come from when I have to scrape the bottom of the box where the pee has gotten stuck. This has VERY small holes, actually a little too small as it takes forever for the litter to fall through and that is with lots of shaking. This cannot be used as the primary scoop as it would take far too long to clean the box but if you are looking for very small holes for say, sand, it would work well. It is very sturdy with no bend to it at all so it should hold up if I ever do use it.",3,0.42857142857142855
"I purchased the green. It is highly visible and works as described. Charges quickly (the USB charging is easy and a great idea!) , and seems good quality. Although the clasp is fairly heavy duty it is still plastic, so when taking my dog for a walk I use this collar in addition to his regular collar, which is combination flat collar/choker. I attach his leash to his regular collar and use the LED collar strictly as a visibility aid. I'm glad for the extra security this time of year as the days are rapidly getting shorter and darker. I would definitely recommend this product. I'm considering looking at their leash as well. I wish everyone walking at night would use some kind of reflective gear or clothing or light to make themselves more visible. Same goes for their dogs. It's hard for drivers to see dark clothing at night, especially when it's rainy. In summary, I'm very happy with this purchase, and assuming it will continue to function well and last a long time, will continue to be happy.",13,1.0

I have ordered extra shelves so I can make an upper level and will still have the double lower level which is plenty of room for my foster kittens. Cons: The wheels are a joke.

"The door itself is made of a durable plastic with the outside part having some weather stripping for a more secure fit. The flaps are a flexible plastic that form a good seal so wind does not enter the house (even during an Arizona haboob). Installation would have been quite easy had I not gone through the wall and used the extension kit. Cutting through the wall was no problem. The extension kit only comes with one sety of long bolts. When assembling the door and extension the bolts ended up being to long, the soft (cheap) bolt head became stripped trying to undo the too long bolts and needed to be cut. No hardware store carried the proper size bolt so I had to improvise with a threaded rod (major pain). What would have been an hour or so installation ended up being four hours with trips to the hardware store and all. Bottom line, the dog door is great, the extension kit/extension installation is poor.",5,0.5
"#1 - Him: My nearly 10 year old, 80 lb. Boxer LOVES his new Kuranda bed!! He has always loved laying around in the backyard, now he can enjoy it in cool comfort. #2 - Me: Easy to clean.

Comfortable (yes, I tried it out). & I was really happy to find the legs come off easily for even more compact storage! The only thing I disliked was the price.

"Cat Kong Hugga / B0018MXYW0 I think I must have picky cats - they fuss a lot for attention, like they are bored, but whenever they get a new toy, they play with it obsessively for the first ten minutes and then never touch it again. It's frustrating, but I thought that maybe the quality of the toys were the problem, and I tossed down for several nice Kong toys, remember how much the puppy had liked them. I like the Wubba because it seems like a really sturdy toy, though I think I like the Hugga version just a little bit more so because it's a lot softer and more like ""small prey"". The Hugga does seem to get dirty a lot faster - the Wubba is very dirt resistant, but the fuzzy Wubba not so much. The only problem is, my cats don't play with the Hugga OR the Wubba as often as I'd hoped - they seem to prefer the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/KONG-Naturals-Crinkle-Ball-with-Feathers/dp/B0018MXX3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">KONG Naturals Crinkle Ball with Feathers</a>&nbsp;more - maybe they are more ""bird cats"" than ""mousers"", I don't know. At any rate, I wouldn't let the fact that my cats didn't much go for the Hugga or the Wubba put you off - like I said, my cats are very picky and weird about toys.

"This is my cat's favorite toy (the mouse attached to the wand). She hasn't been interested in the non-wand toys in the box. She only likes toys that are interactive with humans. I have never seen her go crazy over a toy like this one, and I buy a lot of toys for her. (No, she's not spoiled or anything. :) No toy is indestructible, especially with a cat's sharp claws and teeth. The smooth wooden wand feels good in the hand. It has a hole drilled near the top. The cord came loose but it was easy to thread back in through the hole and tie it. She thinks the mouse is real and once in awhile, she chomps down and tries to drag it away. I found out the hard way that this puts too much stress on the cord where it attaches to the mouse. It didn't break but it stretched enough to make it unreliable. It was easy to sew back in place. It is not a design flaw, it was my operator error in pulling too hard to get the mouse back. Now I just gently detach the mouse from paw or jaw. Overall, I'm very impressed with these toys.

"This poncho is absolutely adorable on my 7-lb. toy poodle. What's more, unlike many polyester-fluff filled dog jackets, which stick up in the back or else fly up in the back when its windy and let the cold air in, this poncho sits evenly on my dog's fur and does not fly up in the wind. This poncho has got to be a lot warmer than those synthetic jackets. As with real human ponchos, there is an inside lining which is black. I'm only going to spot clean mine because I'd be concerned the colors might run. However, I scotchguarded mine and it seems like dirt is easy to brush off. Highly recommend. Update: It is now February 2018 and my dog's poncho is holding up beautifully. I haven't needed to wash it. Maybe it's the Scotchguard but it just doesn't seem to get dirty.",7,0.5

"I purchased the Large 10x19 single flap door Oct 24, 2013, I had purchased one of the cheaper plastic trim doors in the past and it didn't last (plastic trim cracked and fell apart). I installed my new Pacific Endura Flap door in a metal garage entry door. Installation was easy, they give you a template to cut the square hole, I used a reciprocating saw to cut the hole which was no problem. Door fit perfect & looks nice. This door is very well made. The metal frame & plastic door flap are robust and made to last. The flap has a strong magnet to hold closure and is double walled for insulation. I have two medium sized dogs, Blue Heelers; they are constantly in & out. Do not waste your money on the cheaper plastic trim doors.

We put the post in the area he scratched the most. He ignored it at first, but as soon as we used one of the toys around the post, his claws latched onto the post.

"I LOVE this spray. I've been using it for years and highly recommend it. I use this on cat and dog stains in rugs or on carpet. Three big things you need to remember if you want this to work: 1) Dab away as much of the stain moisture as possible 2) Make sure you get the stain when it FIRST happens, not the 2nd or 3rd time or it will be hard to break your pet of the habit 3) Saturate the stain with Bac-Out, making sure you spray a bigger circle of bac-out than the stain is so you get an splatter from the pet mess You do really need to let this soak the stain if you want it to clean it out and destroy the pet enzymes. If it is on a rug, spray it and let it sit for a good 10-15 minutes or more. Clean the stain, dab off any excess moisture and smell it or use a blacklight. You may have to spray more than once, but it will actually take all of the stain out, unlike other pet stain cleaners. If it is on a rug, try to flip the rug and get the bottom as well. Most of them will do little more than mask the smell so that you can hope the pet doesn't go again. I also recommend you close off the area where the stain is for a few days to keep the pet from re-marking the spot. If they found that spot to start with, it was for a reason and they need to stay away from it until the bac-out has completely destroyed the stain. Lastly, after you are completely done cleaning, let the sun help keep it clean. Sunlight seems to help.",11,0.6111111111111112

Less tugging, less worry about accidentally getting some skin in between. What I like best is the fact that the material is not collecting his hair like our last jacket for him.

"My name is Dixie Wiggles (aka, ""Peanut,"" and ""Pee-Wee""), and I am an 18 month old Jack Russell/Dachshund mix. I weigh 22 pounds and my coat is completely blonde in color. I am very cute and sweet - or so they say - but they also tell me I'm a very picky eater. Apparently this causes much consternation and concern for my human mom and dad who, among other things, often ask each other, ""Did she eat anything yet?"" Yes, I admit I have a difficult time eating dog food - especially when I know there's much tastier fare on my mom and dad's plates (which they ""accidentally"" drop on the kitchen floor from time to time.) My mom and dad have tried feeding me several brands of (expensive) high-quality, grain-free dog food - wet and dry - but I just couldn't eat it. Every couple of days, I would nibble at a little of it to placate the poor dears, but my heart wasn't in it. My mom and dad and I finally accepted I just wasn't a big eater. Then a friend gave my mom and dad a sample of this Taste of the Wild to try, and now everything has changed. I no longer sniff at my food, put up my nose, and walk away from my bowl. No more going to bed hungry and no more wasting my mom and dad's money. Much to my mom and dad's (and my) surprise, I have even taken to waiting by my bowl expectantly, consuming every last morsel, and licking my bowl for any remnants. I've even put on a couple of needed pounds, and I have more energy to do my favorite things: chase squirrels, run after balls, and go for walks around the neighborhood.

"Best thing ever! I have tried sooooooooooooooo many products to keep my one cat off of the kitchen counter, none of which were terribly effective.

This meant the Scat spray was constantly needing batteries and the other contraption I purchased (bungee ""spring loaded contraption) was always going off with the slightest tremor and always in the way. This has been the only thing to really work since the my 1 cat is terrified of really loud noises. To me it sounds like a way quieter smoke detector which scare the bejesus out of him.

"Our Pet-Safe feeder has been working great since we bought it 2 weeks ago. I did my research on cat feeders and this because it got 86% positive reviews in the 4/5 star categories. So I ordered it over getting a cheaper brand with poor reviews. Programming the feeder took only about 5 min to understand. It's not tall (14""H), simple, quiet (no grinding noise, all you hear is the food falling into the dish) and is dependable and on time. It holds about a month's worth of food (+-). For our 12lb cat (aka: Tubby), who should eat about a cup of food daily, I programmed the feeder to drop 1/8 cup (3X daytime) and 1/4 cup (2X evening). That's 5 times a day for our cat who needs to be a healthier 9lbs. Cats are nocturnal and sleep more during the day and are more active at night. That's why I programmed the feeder the way I did. Also, I liked the more dependable and quiet conveyor belt system for food dropping. The deeper dish was no problem for our cat. This feeder was worth the extra money.
